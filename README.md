Hello, i got hacked not so long ago. I decided to change all my passwords and to make them effiently i used this website https://www.motdepasse.xyz
Of course i can't remember those by head so i just decided to make a program that would for me. You can just copy the code, transform the passwords and the name of the websites you want to copy the password of. Basically you just click and copy.
If someone wants to add some encryption you can feel free to but i wouldn't bother with that. Most of trojan just read your browser cache and windows directorys, they won't check other programms as the files the malicious user would take to much space, implying too
much time to send.
You just have to click and boom you got a CTRL.C of your password or whatever you'd like to think of.
To make this work you need the following directorys
py.game :
https://www.pygame.org/news
pyper clip : 
https://pypi.org/project/pyperclip/
Then you can turn it into an exe (i used autopytoexe)
https://pypi.org/project/auto-py-to-exe/
